Hi, I'm Aldar Ali, an IT consultant and junior pentester from Horten, Norway. I have a strong passion for cybersecurity and networking and enjoy learning new things about technology. In my work, I monitor systems, handle alarms, and help solve IT problems. I've also worked on projects using AI to improve document handling and built web apps that make processes easier for users. I love working in teams, taking on challenges, and continuously improving my skills. When I'm not busy with work, I'm always exploring the latest in tech and cybersecurity.
