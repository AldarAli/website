# Building Your Own Secure Network Router with OPNsense

In today's digital landscape, network security is paramount. While major manufacturers like TP-Link, ASUS, and D-Link produce various network routers, these devices often face a critical issue: as newer models emerge annually, older routers frequently receive delayed updates or none at all. This update gap creates serious security vulnerabilities that can compromise your entire network.

Fortunately, open source operating systems offer a compelling solution. These free alternatives provide regular updates and enhanced security features thanks to active community development. Among these options, OPNsense stands out as one of the most respected and widely-used open source network and firewall operating systems available.

Even better, you can repurpose your existing hardware to build a custom router/firewall solution that's both cost-effective and secure. This approach not only extends the life of older equipment but also provides you with greater control and customization options than most commercial products.
