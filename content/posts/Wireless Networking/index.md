Before we get started with Aircrack-ng, we need to capture a WPA 4-way handshake between the access point (AP) and a real client(pc, tablet, phone, etc). This handshake contains the necessary information to crack the passphrase (password).

## Step 1: Enable Monitor Mode & Identify the Target

To begin, enable monitor mode on your wireless interface (`wlan0`).

After putting our `wlan0` interface in monitor mode, we now have an interface called `wlan0mon`. We then identify the channel of the target AP and gather its BSSID using:

```bash
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon
```

## Step 2: Capture the WPA Handshake

Our target AP is `SP***`, which operates on channel 1. Its BSSID is `C8:B5:AD:1A:5D:C2`. The `AUTH` column shows the AP uses PSK (Pre-Shared Key).


The `airodump-ng` command on the target AP:

- Listen on channel 1 (`-c 1)
- Save packets to files with the prefix `wpa` (`-w wpa`)
- Filter by ESSID (`--essid sp***`)
- Filter by BSSID (`--bssid C8:B5:AD:1A:5D:C2`)

```bash
sudo airodump-ng -c 1 -w wpa --essid SP*** --bssid `C8:B5:AD:1A:5D:C2` wlan0mon
```

### Step 2.1: Deauthenticate the client

While running `airodump-ng`, we need to deauthenticate a client connected to the AP. This forces the client to reconnect, capturing the handshake.

To deauthenticate a client, we can use `aireplay-ng` with the following command:
```bash
sudo aireplay-ng -0 1 -a C8:B5:AD:1A:5D:C2 wlan0mon
```
the `-0` option stands for `--death`.
- `1` is the number of deauth packets to send
- `-a` specifies the target BSSID
- `wlan0mon` is the interface in monitor mode

After the deauthentication, the client reconnects, and we start  `airodump-ng` to capture the handshake:

A **WPA handshake** were captured, after that a client `4E:EB:06:71:D2:D3` reconnected to the AP.

## Step 3: Crack the WPA Handshake

With the handshake captured, cracking the passphrase is straightforward. Use `aircrack-ng` with a wordlist (e.g., `/usr/share/john/password.lst`), specifying:

- `-w` for the wordlist
- `-e` for the target ESSID (`SP***`)
- `-b` for the BSSID
- The capture file (`wpa-01.cap`)

```bash
aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/john/password.lst -e SP*** -b C8:B5:AD:1A:5D:C2 wpa-01.cap
```
